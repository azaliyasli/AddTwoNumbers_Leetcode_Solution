### ðŸ§  Approach
- We simulate digit-by-digit addition like how we do it manually.
- Start from the least significant digit (head of the list).
- Traverse both input lists while maintaining a carry value.
- For each step, add the two digits and the carry, and create a new node with `val % 10`.
- Update the carry as `val // 10`.
- Continue until all digits and the carry are handled.
